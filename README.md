**Script I developed for my masterâ€™s thesis.**

The script uses data with a 3-hour temporal resolution from CFSR (Climate Forecast System Reanalysis) and the cyclone tracking database by Gramcianinov et al. (2020). The respective access links are included in the script.

The script selects, classifies, and plots cyclone composites in polar coordinates!  
Classification is based on the methodology of Hart (2003), the Cyclone Phase Space, and the definition of bombs by Sanders & Gyakum (1980).
